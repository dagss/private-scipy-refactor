Description:
    SciPy (pronounced "Sigh Pie") is open-source software for mathematics,
    science, and engineering. The SciPy library
    depends on NumPy, which provides convenient and fast N-dimensional
    array manipulation. The SciPy library is built to work with NumPy
    arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical
    routines such as routines for numerical integration and optimization.
    Together, they run on all popular operating systems, are quick to
    install, and are free of charge.  NumPy and SciPy are easy to use,
    but powerful enough to be depended upon by some of the world's
    leading scientists and engineers. If you need to manipulate
    numbers on a computer and display or publish the results,
    give SciPy a try!
